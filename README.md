# Google Sheets Synchronizer

A Unity editor extension for synchronizing data from **Google Sheets** directly into your project.  
Built with [Odin Inspector](https://odininspector.com/) for a clean and powerful editor UI and [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) for modern async operations.

---

## ✨ Features
- Download CSV data directly from **Google Sheets**.
- View and manage synchronized data inside a custom **Odin Editor Window**.
- Async operations powered by **UniTask** (no coroutines needed).
- Built-in error handling for network requests.

---

## 📦 Requirements
- **Unity** 2021.3 or newer (tested).
- [Odin Inspector](https://odininspector.com/) – required for editor UI.
- [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) – required for async/await support.

> ⚠️ If Odin Inspector is not installed, the editor window will not be available, but synchronization can work.
